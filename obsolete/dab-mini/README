dab-mini implements a small GUI on the top of the full set of Qt-DAB sources.

Basically, two files - and device drivers - had to be changed for that.

In the main program, some of the (few) command line options were removed
The file "radio.cpp" (as well as the header file "radio.h") were adapted
to deal with a simpler interface. The class RadioInterface, implemented
in that file, responds to signals from the GUI, but also handles
all signals arriving from the different parts of the DAB implementation.

The file radio.cpp therefore contains a lot of "slots" doing nothing,
and it carrier a lot of buffers,
needed as parameter for the classes instantiated, while it is certain that nothing will be done with the data in those buffers.

The device handlers needed some change as well. They are kept in
a directory "devices-dab-mini". In the setup chose here, there are no
separate widgets for device control. All control is in maximum 2 spinboxes
and one checkbox.

Creating an executable is using either the qmake or the cmake route

For qmake: edit the dab-mini.pro file to select (unselect) devices for the
configuration.

For cmake:
	mkdir build
	cd build
	cmake .. -DXXXX=ON -DYYY=ON ... -DZZZ=ON

where
	-DMMM=ON
is specified for device MMM
